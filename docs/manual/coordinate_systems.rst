Active vs Passive Rotations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A rotation can either represent the rotation of a point in a fixed coordinate system (known an active rotation) or
the rotation of a coordinate system about a point (known as a passive rotation). Passive rotations are used
consistently through out OAL. The active rotation can be obtained though the inverse of the passive rotation.
