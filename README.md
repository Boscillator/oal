# O.A.L.
Open Aerospace Library. Unopinionated, open source, and correct utilities for aerospace applications.

## Goals
- **Unopinionated:** Do not impose constraints on conventions and code
  architecture. Allow integration with legacy code. Provide sensible defaults.
- **Text-book grade documentation:** You should be able to understand the
  algorithms provided, and there limitations, simply by reading the docs.
- **Correct:** Provide sufficient testing to demonstrate trust in the
  correctness of the routines.
- **C++ and Python as first class citizens:** The same algorithms should be
  useable between a trade study script and flight code.
